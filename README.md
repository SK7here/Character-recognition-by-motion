First compile **MLP Model.py** to build your MLP model to predict the alphabets

Then, compile **Handwriting_recognizer.py** and *start writing with a bottle cap in front of web cam*

NOTE: I have made the input to be taken in real time from ***Webcam***. If needed, you can make the model to take a preloaded video to be the input
